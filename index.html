          <h2>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Hogwarts is divided into four houses, each bearing the last name of
            its founder: Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw
            and Helga Hufflepuff. Throughout the school year, the houses compete
            for the House Cup, gaining and losing points based on actions such as
            performance in class and rule violations. The house with the highest
            end-of-year total wins and has its colours displayed in the Great Hall
            for the following school year. Each house also has its own Quidditch
            team that competes for the Quidditch Cup.
